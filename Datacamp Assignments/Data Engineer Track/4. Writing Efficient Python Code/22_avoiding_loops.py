You successfully used list comprehension and the map() function to 
eliminate a for loop. If you compared runtimes between the for loop 
and using list comprehension with a map() function, you'd see that 
the for loop took quite a bit longer.

If you're an experienced Pythonista, you may have noticed 
that you could replace the entire for loop with one list comprehension: 

[(name, len(name)) for name,gen in zip(poke_names, poke_gens) if gen < 3]
