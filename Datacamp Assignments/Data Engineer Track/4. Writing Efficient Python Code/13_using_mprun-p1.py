The total sum of the memory allocated for these four lines should be greater than 0.0 MiB. 
If you run %mprun multiple times within your session, you may notice that the Increment column 
reports 0.0 MiB for all lines of code. This is due to a limitation with the magic command (not your fault). 
If you encounter this issue, restart your session and re-run all the 
necessary steps for using %mprunâ€”but this time, only use %mprun once to answer the question.

'''
Using a list comprehension approach allocates anywhere from 0.1 MiB to 2 MiB of memory to calculate your BMIs.

If you run %mprun multiple times within your session, you may notice that the Increment column reports 0.0 MiB for all lines of code. 
This is due to a limitation with the magic command. After running %mprun once, the memory allocation analyzed previously is taken into 
account for all consecutive runs and %mprun will start from the place the first run left off.

Now that we've profiled the calc_bmi_lists() function, let's see if you can do better with a different approach.
