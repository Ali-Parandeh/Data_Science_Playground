# import the numpy package
import numpy as np

# create an array class object
arr = np.array([8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9])

# use the sort method
arr.sort()

# print the sorted array
print(arr)

'''
<script.py> output:
    [0 3 5 6 7 8 9]

Thanks to numpy's use of modularity you were able 
to solve the exercise using concise & readable code.
