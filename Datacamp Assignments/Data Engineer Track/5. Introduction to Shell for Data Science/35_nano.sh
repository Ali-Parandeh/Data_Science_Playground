# How can I edit a file?

# Unix has a bewildering variety of text editors. For this course, we will use a simple one called Nano. If you type nano filename, it will open filename for editing (or create it if it doesn't already exist). You can move around with the arrow keys, delete characters using backspace, and do other operations with control-key combinations:

# Ctrl + K: delete a line.
# Ctrl + U: un-delete a line.
# Ctrl + O: save the file ('O' stands for 'output'). You will also need to press Enter to confirm the filename!
# Ctrl + X: exit the editor.

$ nano names.txt
